				Our budgeting app is different than other apps because it is specific to UC students. We will build in certain expenses that are specific to UC students. Many UC students struggle with finances and budgeting. Our app will enable them to budget their money in a much more efficient manner. Everyone in our group has experience with bank accounts and budgeting. We feel we can research common college budgeting tips and incorporate those with our own knowledge. Our design will also have flexibility and allow the user to be in control and customize how their finances are budgeted.
